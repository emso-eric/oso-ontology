# üåä OSO - Observatories of Seas Ontology

## Overview

**OSO (Observatories of Seas Ontology)** provides a semantic framework to describe marine research infrastructures, with a focus on deep-sea observatories operated by EMSO-ERIC and national nodes like EMSO-France.

Version **0.15** (published on July 23, 2025) improves syntax compliance, FAIRness, and semantic alignment with existing vocabularies and data standards.

## üìÇ Access

- **Ontology IRI**: [https://w3id.org/earthsemantics/OSO](https://w3id.org/earthsemantics/OSO)
- **Documentation (HTML)**: [https://emso-eric.github.io/oso-ontology/](https://emso-eric.github.io/oso-ontology/)
- **WebVOWL Visualisation of the OSO Ontology**: [https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/#iri=https://earthportal.eu/ontologies/OSO](https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/#iri=https://earthportal.eu/ontologies/OSO)

## üß≠ Objectives

- To provide a common vocabulary for describing marine observatories and their components.
- To enhance interoperability of data across European marine research infrastructures.
- To support data publication and discovery in FAIR-compliant data portals.
- To align with existing ontologies and standards (SOSA, DCAT, GeoSPARQL, PROV-O).

## ‚ú® Highlights of version 0.15

- Ontology IRI: `https://w3id.org/earthsemantics/OSO/0.15`
- Published on **July 23, 2025**
- Improved syntax compliance (spaces, punctuation, consistent `dcterms:` usage)
- Enriched multilingual metadata and annotation properties
- New and updated instances for sites and platforms
- FAIR score: **62%** (according to O'FAIRe) ‚Äî with targeted improvements under way

## FAIRification Roadmap

This ontology is progressively being aligned with the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) using the [O'FAIRe evaluation framework](https://www.ofaire.eu/).  
The detailed improvement plan is available in the following file:

‚û°Ô∏è [FAIR-roadmap-OSO.md](./FAIR-roadmap-OSO.md)

We welcome feedback and contributions to improve its FAIRness over time.
