# OSO Ontology ‚Äì EMSO ERIC Hierarchical Extraction Tool

This script extracts a 5-level hierarchy from the OSO ontology and generates an Excel file (`.xlsx`) containing only the **Regional Facilities** that are part of **EMSO ERIC**, along with their associated Sites, Subsites, Platforms, and Subplatforms.

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Python **3.10** or higher
- Required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install rdflib pandas openpyxl
```

---

## üìÇ Input File

- The input ontology file must be named: `oso.ttl`
- It should be placed in the same folder as the script.
- The ontology must include object properties with the following semantics:
  - `oso:containsSite`
  - `oso:containsPlatform`
  - `oso:Site_has_a_Subsite`
  - `oso:Platform_contains_Subplatforms`
  - `oso:Regional_Facility_is_part_of_EMSO_ERIC`

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Once the required libraries are installed and the `oso.ttl` ontology file is placed in the working directory, run the script with:

```bash
python oso_extraction_hierarchy_EMSO_ERIC.py
```

If successful, this will generate the file:

```
OSO_RF_Site_Platform_Filtered_EMSO.xlsx
```

## üìä Extraction of EMSO ERIC Hierarchical View

A script is provided in the [`extraction/`](../extraction) folder to generate an Excel file containing only the Regional Facilities that are part of **EMSO ERIC**, along with their associated Sites, Subsites, Platforms, and Subplatforms.

- Script: [`extraction/oso_extraction_hierarchy_EMSO_ERIC.py`](../extraction/oso_extraction_hierarchy_EMSO_ERIC.py)
- Input file: `oso.ttl`
- Output file: `OSO_RF_Site_Platform_Filtered_EMSO.xlsx`

‚û°Ô∏è [See example output file (as of 2025-07-15)](../extraction/OSO_RF_Site_Platform_Filtered_EMSO_2025-07-15.xlsx)

Run with:
```bash
python oso_extraction_hierarchy_EMSO_ERIC.py
